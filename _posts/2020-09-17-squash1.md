## Introduction
I am going through the CS109 Harvard lectures on data science. I just watched a couple of lectures on web-scraping with BeautifulSoup, so I wanted to practice. I decided to scrape squash ranking data from wikipedia, as I am a avid fan of the sport. On wikipedia, the best information I could find was the top 10 players at the end of each year for the past 25 years or so.

## Results
The results of the scraping process are in the following tables, summarising some key stats for the players. The tables are ordered by players' average rank in the dataset. It is worth emphasising that the data only contains information on Top 10 rankings and only at the end of each year; this will skew the data in various ways.

## Patterns and observations
It is satisfying to be able to compare the various big names in squash.

* From this, the most outstanding player is Nicol David. They have the largest number of years in the top 10 of any female player by a big margin, and she has the 3rd best average rating. Only two players have a higher average rating: Sarah Fitz-Gerald's average is for practical purposes the same (2.33 vs 2.35) and Michelle Martin's is probably skewed by the fact the data only goes as far back as 1994.
* A stand-out statistic is that Gaultier has been in the Top 10 for 15 years! Though it is mentioned by commentators frequently, it is only when I compare it to other players' durations do I fully appreciate how incredible the achievement is. Nick Matthew is not far behind with 14 years.
*  Another surprise for me is how high Ramy Ashour is, compared to other players. It is well-recognised that he is the best player of his generation by a large margin, but he has also been plagued by injury for most of it, too. I would have predicted that it would have had a noticable dent on his stats. It is scary to think how much better his stats would have been if he did not have injuries!
*  Ali Farag's average is very high. Though I do not want to diminish this achievement, I think this is a reflection of how the modern game has fewer elite players, whereas ten years ago, 7 or 8 of the top 10 players had all achieved a World Ranking of 1.
* It is interesting to see general patterns. E.g. the players who have spent the most years in the top 10 are also players with higher averages and higher maximum ranks. For the males, this pattern is stark: if they have spent at least 9 years in the Top-10 rankings then they have reached the No. 1 spot.  For the females, the pattern is not as clear. This might suggeset that female squash has had a few players that have dominated the top spot, with the remaining players competiting for the other spots in the top 10.


Like I said earlier, the data is skewed in various ways.
* The data only includes rankings at the end of each year. This will hide variations throughout the year. If you use monthly data instead, I expect the patterns will be clearer, and the best players will stand out even more from the good players.
* The data only includes rankings that are in the top 10. For the absolute best players, this is not a loss of much data, but for the players in the 5-10 range, significant data is missing about their ranking history.
* The data only goes back to the early 90s. This skews data by missing out the achievements of previous great players. The main one is Jahangir Khan, who had a 500+ match winning streak in the 80s!


## Next steps
I will see if I can find more detailed ranking information, so I can get a more fine-grained analysis of the players. A project I have in the back of my mind is to create my own ranking system based on match history, and see if I can create a system which is more predictive than the current system. I think this should be possible, but again, I will need to see if I can obtain the relevant data.
