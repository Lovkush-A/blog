## Introduction
In the previous post, I scraped squash ranking data and produced a dataframe out of it. I then simply eye-balled the table to see the patterns. However, doing some kind of visualisation is always better than just listing a table, so that is what I did next.  Furthermore, I decided to finally try out some dimension reduction algorithms and clustering to help with the visualisations and pattern-finding.

### PCA
I first tried using PCA on the data and see how it would present the data.
