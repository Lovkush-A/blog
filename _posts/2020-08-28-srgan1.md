## Introduction
I wanted to print out an image for a friend, and I wanted to first crop the image to only include a relatively small part of the photo (namely, the individuals in the photo. The original photo was 90% scenary).  However, after the cropping, the image became too small and would have been pixelated when printed.  I thought that a neural network ought to be able to solve this problem, because it could be trained on a manually created dataset (just take a bunch of images and use these as the *outputs*, then reduce the quality of these images to create the *inputs*). I decided to Google around to see what already had been done, and I found out about SRGANs.  At my current level of knowledge, I cannot understand the details of the architecture, so for now, my aim was just to see if I could use a pre-trained network to achieve my goal. After a bit more searching, I found [this Github repo](https://github.com/HasnainRaz/Fast-SRGAN).

## Steps taken
* Create a new directory and environment.
* Download the github repo.
* Install the requirements.
* Create a directory `inputs` for input images, and folder `outputs` for where the output images will go.
* Add images to the inputs directory.
* Run the command `python infer.py --image_dir 'inputs' --output_dir 'outputs'

## Results
Below are samples of the images, comparing before and after applying the neural network.

### Example 1
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/srgan1_1.png)

### Example 2
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/srgan1_2.png)

### Example 3
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/srgan1_3.png)

This is amazing! This feels like magic to me. 

## Limits
I tried applying this to blurry images, expecting it to make the images less blurry. This did not happen:

![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/srgan1_4.png)

This reveals how limited my understanding is! After thinking and googling a bit, I think the issue is that resolution and blurriness/sharpness are two separate issues. Previously, I just lumped them together as 'reasons an image can look bad'. After a bit more searching, it seems I might learn about anti-blurring / sharpening in the FastAI course that I am doing, so that is something to look forward to.

Finally, I hope I will soon be at at stage where I can understand these intricate architectures, and be able to train my own cutting edge neural networks.
