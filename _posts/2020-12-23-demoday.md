title: Presentations. Turning good slides into great slides

## Introduction
In this post, I will describe how I turned a decent presentation into a great one. But first some context.

At the end of the [Faculty Data Science Fellowship](https://faculty.ai/fellowship/), Faculty hosts an event called 'Demo Day', in which the fellows each give a 5-minute presentatation to showcase what they achieved in the project. Over 300 people from the data science industry attend this event, so these presentations are a big deal.  You can see many of the demo day presentations on [Faculty's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaiUkj_9GAncPqJxvbBUkWA/videos).

Because Demo Day is important, we literally spend a whole week preparing the presentation, giving our talk to a dozen or so different people in Faculty, and iteratively improve based on their feedback.

I found this to be an insightful experience. My first draft of the presentation was decent, but it was incredible to get all the feedback on how I can improve. I find this to be a rare experience, because there is a societal norm to always be positive and avoid (constructive) criticism. (Or I just don't know how to ask for feedback!)  Furthermore, if you search online or attend a workshop on presentations, you will be shown examples of terrible presentations and told about basic things (don't have paragraphs of text, use consistent colours and fonts, etc.).  Sometimes you may get some real insights, e.g. [Tim Urban's](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/doing-a-ted-talk-the-full-story.html) post about how they prepared for their TED talk.

So, I hope this blogpost will be useful, and will help you improve your presentations in the future as much as it will help me improve mine.

## Structure of blogpost
I will focus on the visual aspect of the presentation, i.e. the slides. For each section of slides I will:
* Show the earliest version of the slides
* Describe roughly what I would say for those slides
* Ask you to think how you might improve the slides
* Show you different versions of the slides
* Describe what changes were made and why they were made

I strongly encourage you to really think about how you might improve the slides. You will learn more if you do this, than if you just passively read.

Context:
> Suppose Mo is a surgeon at his local private hospital. He is unhappy because he feels like he is experiencing discrimination from them. So he does what any good American would do, and he sues them! Lawyers are hired to resolve the disagreement. In order for the lawyers to do their job, they need to know what the facts of the matter are, and one way to do this is to interview potential witnesses.
