title: Presentations. Turning good slides into great slides
---

## Introduction
In this post, I will describe how I turned a decent presentation into a great one. But first some context.

At the end of the [Faculty Data Science Fellowship](https://faculty.ai/fellowship/), Faculty hosts an event called 'Demo Day', in which the fellows each give a 5-minute presentatation to showcase what they achieved in the project. Over 300 people from the data science industry attend this event, so these presentations are a big deal.  You can see many of the demo day presentations on [Faculty's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaiUkj_9GAncPqJxvbBUkWA/videos).

Because Demo Day is important, we literally spend a whole week preparing the presentation, giving our talk to a dozen or so different people in Faculty, and iteratively improve based on their feedback.

I found this to be an insightful experience. My first draft of the presentation was decent, but it was incredible to get all the feedback on how I can improve. I find this to be a rare experience, because there is a societal norm to always be positive and avoid (constructive) criticism. (Or I just don't know how to ask for feedback!)  Furthermore, if you search online or attend a workshop on presentations, you will be shown examples of terrible presentations and told about basic things (don't have paragraphs of text, use consistent colours and fonts, etc.).  Sometimes you may get some real insights, e.g. [Tim Urban's](https://waitbutwhy.com/2016/03/doing-a-ted-talk-the-full-story.html) post about how they prepared for their TED talk.

So, I hope this blogpost will be useful, and will help you improve your presentations in the future as much as it will help me improve mine.

## Structure of blogpost
I will focus on the visual aspect of the presentation, i.e. the slides. For each section of slides I will:
* Show the earliest version of the slides
* Provide context for the slides, by quoting roughly what I would say
* Ask you to think how you might improve the slides
* Show you different versions of the slides
* Describe what changes were made and why they were made

I strongly encourage you to really think about how you might improve the slides. You will learn more if you do this, than if you just passively read.


## Slides 1
Version 1:
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/demoday1_1.gif)

Context:
> Suppose Mo is a surgeon at his local private hospital. He is unhappy because he feels like he is experiencing discrimination from them. So he does what any good American would do, and he sues them! Lawyers are hired to resolve the disagreement. In order for the lawyers to do their job, they need to know what the facts of the matter are, and one way to do this is to interview potential witnesses.

How would you improve the slides? This might the hardest example to think of improvements, because the slides are already pretty good, unlike many of the other slides to come.

Version 2:
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/demoday1_2.gif)

Changes:
There are three changes here, and they were all suggested by a Graphic Designer [Nadine Daouk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nadinedaouk/).
* Have the icons of the lawyers match the style of the other icons
* Have thick-ish margins / white space on the outside of the slides
* Use different sizes of icons, to create 'hierarchy' in the slide. For me, this is the single big new idea I learnt from the whole experience. The idea is that on every slide, it should be clear what is the most important piece of information on it. In this case, Mo and the hospital are the two major people in the situation, followed by the lawyers, followed by the witnesses. That is not clear in the final slide of Version 1, but it is clear in Version 2.

Additional thoughts:

First, it was such a pleasure to watch an expert at work. I am still taken aback by how Nadine provided feedback on my presentation: for every single slide, she instantly noticed if something was off and knew precisely what to do to improve it. It really was remarkable.

Second, this idea of hierarchy is an 'advanced' idea. It only becomes relevant once you have removed all the basic errors (e.g. having too much information on the slide) *and* if there is a difference in importance in the information in the slide. Another example of hierarchy is changing the font size or colour to indicate which words on a slide are vital and which are secondary.


## Slides 2
Version 1:
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/demoday2_1.gif)

Context:
> Each witness is interviewed one at a time. There is somebody in the room furiously typing away, and at the end of the interview a written record of everything that was said is created.

How would you improve the slides? Big hint: I will be repeating myself quite a lot!

Version 2:
![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/demoday2_2.gif)

Changes:
* Have the icons of the lawyers, typewriter and table match the style of the other icons
* Have margins / white space on the outside of the slides

Additional thoughts:
There is going to be significant repetition in the slides, but that is the nature of these things. Lastly, in the final version of the presentation, these slides were actually cut because I had to shorten this part of the talk.
