## Introduction
In a previous post, I described how the joining missed out half the data. After making various plots, is turns out the joining was sometimes erroneous too. Hence, I bit the bullet and decided I to manually do the joining, and get a complete and clean dataset. Learning the lessons from past attempts at manual processing, it was a fairly smooth process. (Furthermore, things were significantly sped up by using Selenium - which allowed me to automate the process of searching for a movie on imdb). In the end, it took roughly 3 hours to tidy the dataset and have the official imdb id attached to each entry in my database. And now for the charts!

## Year of release
Below are charts showing information about the year of release for the movies I have watched. The first one is just a histogram, and the second shows a scatter-chart showing the year I watched the movie against the year the movie released.

Not sure if there is anything surprising about any of these charts. One neat thing is that one could probably get an idea of my age based on the first chart. The second chart seems to show that the majority of movies I watch are relatively new.

## Ratings
Below is a chart showing the average ratings (by users of imdb) for the movies I have watched, along with the distribution of ratings for all the movies in imdb.

![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mymovies5_ratings1.png)

It is clear from this chart that I tend to watch 'decent' movies, as judged by imdb users, and that I avoid 'bad' movies, but I also seem to avoid the 'best' movies.

Below is a chart comparing the ratings for all the movies I have watched with the ratings of the movie I would recommend.

It is reassuring to see that, overall, the movies I recommend are generally better regarded than the movies I do not recommend. 

Lastly, here is a chart showing the variation in ratings by the year I watched the movie.

![image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mymovies5_ratings3.png)

I cannot really discern any patterns here, that aren't revealed by other charts. Patterns that I can see are that I watched a lot more movies (and greater variety of quality of  movies) in 2008 and 2009, and that the movies I recommend tend to have higher ratings than those I don't.

To end this section, here is a list of the most and least popular movies I have watched.

The one thing I feel slightly ashamed of is that I watched so many of the Friday the 13th movies. I think my reasoning was that if a series has that many movies, there must be something good about it. I kept going on, even though I thought the movies were bad, in the hope that there is a moment in the series where the movies become good. I did finally stop watching the series - it just took eight movies to make that decision...

## Genres
Below is a table showing a breakdown of the genres of movie I watched, ordered by which genre has the highest odds of me recommending it. Note that most movies had multiple genres.

The entries that stand out to me are those with the largest frequencies. There is strong evidence that I am more likely to recommend a thriller or a drama than a comedy, and that I am unlikely to recommend adventure or action movies.

I tend not to pay any attention to who the director is, so for me, the interesting thing here is to see how movies that I would have said had no connection in fact have the same director. E.g. I did not realise I had watched that many movies by Spielberg. The other thing that stands out here is that all the directors are male.

Nice list of some of the more famous actors in the industry. One thing that surprised is how many movies I have watched that starred Brad Pitt - I did not realise it was that many! Once again, it is worth noting that females are under-represented here.


## Conclusion
This project has probably been the one that I spent the most time on so far. I have learnt a whole bunch and managed to produce some nice visuals and summaries. Hopefully it was interesting to read!
