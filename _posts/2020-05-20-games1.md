title: AIs for Games, Part I
---

I want to create AIs that can play games using neural networks. To start off, I coded up TicTacToe and then had an AI play it using a brute force algorithm. The code for this is available on [github](https://github.com/Lovkush-A/games).

## The AI in Action
Below are screenshots illustrating the AI in action. 

1) I run the program, select the AI to play first, and respond to its first move.

2) The AI plays in the top left, forcing me to play in the middle left.

3) The end is nigh. The AI creates two threats at once. I stop one of them...

4) But I cannot stop both.

AI: 1, Humans: 0.



## Comments
This program is highly inefficient. E.g it will search through every possible move, even if it has already found a winning sequence. My focus was on getting something working, rather than trying to optimise it.

My next steps are:
* Coding up more complicated games. I have already done this for Pentago (see [github](https://github.com/Lovkush-A/games)).
* Coding up the alpha-beta pruning algorithm
* Coding up a neural network to create a heuristic function
