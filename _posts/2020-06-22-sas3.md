## Total number of stops and searches

### Grouped by ethnicity
I start by plotting the total number of stops and searches (since May 2017 because that is the earliest data of the dataset), grouped by ethnicity.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/sas3_sas_eth.png) 

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```

## Code
Here I provide sample of the code used to produce the charts.

Below is the code to produce the first bar chart.

```python
colours_255 = [(66, 133, 244,255), (234, 67, 53,255), (251, 188, 5,255), (52, 168, 83, 255)]

colours = [ tuple(n / 255 for n in colour) for colour in colours_255]

plt.figure
sns.barplot(x = sas_ethnicity.index, y = sas_ethnicity,
           order = ['White', 'Black', 'Asian', 'Other'],
           palette = colours)
plt.grid(True, axis = 'y')
plt.title('Stop and Searches since May 2017, by Ethnicity')
plt.xlabel('Ethnicity')
plt.ylabel('Number of Stop and Searches')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('sas3_sas_eth.png')
```
