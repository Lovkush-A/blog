## Total number of stops and searches

### Grouped by ethnicity
I start by plotting the total number of stops and searches (since May 2017 because that is the earliest data of the dataset), grouped by ethnicity.

From this chart, a simplistic conlusion would be that white people are searched significantly more than other ethnicities, so there is no racism in the system. This is clearly a bad reasoning, as we need to account for the underlying population.

### Including population
Population data is taken from [here](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/uk-population-by-ethnicity/national-and-regional-populations/population-of-england-and-wales/latest#:~:text=the%20total%20population%20of%20England%20and%20Wales%20was%2056.1%20million,White%20ethnic%20group%20(4.4%25)). I use this data to produce the following chart. Note that I grouped the various numbers together in the same way I grouped ethnicities together in producing the ethnicities column.

Now things look bad. There is clearly a discrepancy between the population and the number of stop and searches.

To visualise this discrepancy more clearly, I decided to create a [Sankey diagram](http://www.sankey-diagrams.com/) using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/sankey-diagram/).

 


## Code
Here I provide sample of the code used to produce the charts.

Below is the code to produce the first bar chart.

```python
colours_255 = [(66, 133, 244,255), (234, 67, 53,255), (251, 188, 5,255), (52, 168, 83, 255)]

colours = [ tuple(n / 255 for n in colour) for colour in colours_255]

plt.figure
sns.barplot(x = sas_ethnicity.index, y = sas_ethnicity,
           order = ['White', 'Black', 'Asian', 'Other'],
           palette = colours)
plt.grid(True, axis = 'y')
plt.title('Stop and Searches since May 2017, by Ethnicity')
plt.xlabel('Ethnicity')
plt.ylabel('Number of Stop and Searches')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('sas3_sas_eth.png')
```
