title: 4 ways I conceptualise Bayes Theorem
---

## Introduction
One of the big lessons I have learnt is that no matter how well (you think) you understand something, there is almost always a deeper or clearer level of understanding available. Even for trivially simple things, like addition. Today, I will describe my experience with this phenomena in the context of Baye's Theorem, by going through four different ways I have of conceptualising it.

Recall that Bayes Theorem states that:
$$P(A | B) = \frac{P(A) P(B|A)}{P(B)}$$

## Algebraic
For a long time, the main way I thought about Baye's Theorem was that it was just a consequence of some algebraic re-arrangement:

$$
P(B \cap A) = P(A \cap B)
P(B) P(A|B) = P(A) P(B|A)
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A) P(B|A)}{P(B)}
$$
