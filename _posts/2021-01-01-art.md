title: Using Data Science to Create Art

## Introduction
While working with Lexitas to process deposition transcripts, I was trying to find the best tools and settings to visual clusters of questions. Several of the choices lead to visually striking plots. I was pleasantly surprised by this. My mentors enjoyed looking at these, so I figured other people mght like them as well.

## How the art was created
The dataset was a list of questions taken from a single deposition transcript. Importantly, and surprisingly, all the images to follow are all representations of this *same dataset*.

I then vectorised the sentences using various tools (e.g. tfidf and glove vectors) and did dimension reduction using either tSNE or UMAP. I then plotted the resulting data using Bokeh.

## Final Thoughts
What do you think? The main thing that surprised me about this is that these are all representations of the same underlying dataset! When I showed these to my mentors, they said that there is a little joke that if you spend long enough, you can get whatever you want in unsupervised learning.

Lastly, I think it is nice that while I am grinding away trying to determine what is the most valuable for my clients, I can get these little pleasant surprises on the side.
