1. I decided to create a blog after reading
[David Robinson's](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/) advice. I had
read many times before that I ought to create a blog/portfolio, but somehow this
article was the tipping point. I recommend reading it!

2. I got a basic understanding of Jekyll and Github Pages by following
[Jonathan McGlone's](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) guide.
It has minimal pre-requisites and is accessible to beginners.
I did not follow all the steps, but it was a good starting point. It was
easy to get something up and running, and it recommends resources to move forwards.

3. I followed [Jekyll's'](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/01-setup/)
step-by-step tutorial. This is excellent. It is clear and
it builds things up logically.  A few minor details:
    * I created a Conda environment in which I installed Ruby and Jekyll.
    * I cloned the GitHub repository from Step 2 into this enviroment, and adapted
    the steps as appropriate (e.g. copying the CSS from Step 2 into the SASS file).
    * I do not set up 'authors', as I am going to be the only author on this blog!

As with most of these things, the upfront cost is high and it requires patience
to get through it. But now that I have done it, I am extremely pleased.
Having created [my personal website](http://www.lovkush.com) using a
hodge-podge of HTML, CSS and PHP, I can appreciate how much smoother
Jekyll makes everything. It is refreshing.

Goodbye, angled-brackets! You shan't be missed.
