## Introduction
At the end of [Lecture 3 of the 2020 FastAI course](https://youtu.be/5L3Ao5KuCC4?t=7244) and at the end of [Lecture 2 of the 2018 FastAI course](https://youtu.be/ccMHJeQU4Qw?t=6394), there are visualisations of the gradient descent algorithm. I quite liked them, in particular the animation from the 2018 version, and I wanted to re-create them and on more complex examples.

The animations I created are available below. Note that in all animations, the orange dots represent the training data, and the blue line represents the model's predictions. I will go through them and give my thoughts. At the end I describe some insights I gained by doing this.

## Linear data
I created some linear data `y = a*x + b + noise`, and then tried to use gradient descent to determine the coefficients.

</figure>

This animation is representative of the various examples I tried for linear data. Gradient descent is quick to get very close to the data, but then the learning dramatically slows down and it takes many iterations to improve further.  Clearly, there is some optimisation that can be done with the learning rate; I did try to create a cutoff point where the learning rate gets bigger, but I am sure there are much better ways of doing things.

## Quadratic data
