My name is Lovkush Agarwal. I recently decided to change careers and become a
data scientist. Following [David Robinson's'](http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/)
advice, I decided to create this blog.

To find out more about me, check out [my personal website](http://www.lovkush.com).

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].
