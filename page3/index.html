<div class="home"><h1 id="welcome">Welcome!</h1>

<p>My name is Lovkush Agarwal. I recently decided to change careers and become a
data scientist. Following <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/r/start-blog/">David Robinson’s’</a>
advice, I decided to create this blog, to record my progress, learning and projects.</p>
