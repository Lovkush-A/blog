<h2 id="the-algorithm">
<a class="anchor" href="#the-algorithm" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The algorithm</h2>
<p>In my last post, I said I wanted to code up an alpha-beta pruning algorithm. (See this <a href="https://youtu.be/WbzNRTTrX0g">CS50 Intro to AI</a> lecture for background on tree-based search and alpha-beta pruning). Over the past couple of weeks, I have been thinking about exactly how the algorithm would work and how I would code it up, and it was surprisingly tricky. I therefore decided to just focus on creating an algorithm that would search through a game-tree up to some maximum depth, but in a way that I could add in the pruning.</p>

<p>The algorithm should determine the ‘value’ of the current board state and the move that would achieve that value. A value of 1 means that Player 1 will win (with perfect play) and a value of 0 means that Player 0 will win (with perfect play). A value in the middle indicates which player is more likely to win, as judged by the algorithm.</p>

<p>The general idea of the algorithm is straightforward:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Given a board position, create an initial node and add it to the frontier.</li>
  <li>While the initial node does not have a value, pick a node from the frontier and do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Check if the game has ended. If so, determine who won, and set the value of the node appropriately. Then update the value of parent nodes appropriately.</li>
      <li>Check if the depth of the node is the maximum depth. If so, then estimate the value of the position. For now, I just set this as 0.5, but in future, this will be determined via a neural network. Then update the value of parent nodes appropriately.</li>
      <li>Create a list of legal moves and possible board positions arising from this node. Create new nodes and add them to the frontier.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once the initial node has a value, pick a move whose resulting board position has the same value.</li>
</ol>

<p>The tricky part was the step ‘update the value of the parent nodes appropriately’. It took me some time to flesh out all the details and determine exactly when a parent node should have its value updated. I had to do this in a way so that I could add on the pruning later without having to change the structure of the code. The main ideas were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever a node has its value determined, the upper or lower bounds of its parent’s node, and only its parent’s node, needs to be updated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Whenever all of a node’s children’s values are determined, the node’s value can be determined. This will sometimes lead to some recursive updating of node values.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A big sticking point for me was how to decide when to prune a node: it felt like I needed knowledge of uncle/aunt nodes to do this, but following the ideas above, the grandparent node and parent node should contain enough information to decide if a node can be pruned or not.</p>

<p>In the end, I managed to get it altogether. The code, at this stage of the project, can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Lovkush-A/games/tree/e8a8e0afe6d25030d82cf0f0269c5edab625e463">github</a>.</p>

<a class="anchor" href="#an-example" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>An example</h2>
<p><img src="/blog/images/games_21.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>The image above shows an example winning position for player 1. If it is Player 1’s move, the algorithm finds a winning move using a depth-1 search (play in bottom left, and then rotate bottom left clockwise, giving 5-in-a-row column on left-hand-side).  If it is Player 2’s move, the algorithm returns <code class="highlighter-rouge">None</code> using a depth-2 search, because no matter what 2 does on this turn, 1 will always win.</p>

<p>The algorithm is highly inefficient. It takes roughly 10-50 seconds to do depth-2 searches, and on the order of hours for depth-3 search. This is way too long! The number of possible positions after 3 moves is roughly a few million, so that shouldn’t take hours to sort through.</p>

<p>There are many inefficiencies I am aware of and will fix them for my next post. Examples include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dealing with repeat positions. Right now, I only avoid positions that repeat if they arise from the same parent.</li>
  <li>I currently use a list to track which positions have been visited in the search, to check for repeats. This is less efficient than a set, but I can’t use arrays in sets and all my boards are coded as arrays. I will try changing everything to tuples.</li>
  <li>If a winning/losing sequence is found, it will keep on searching. This is not necessarily a bad thing, because we might want to analyse all the lines, but it definitely slows things down.</li>
  <li>Not using alpha-beta pruning, yet.</li>
  <li>Not doing any time analysis. I will run cProfile to systematically find inefficiencies.</li>
</ul>
